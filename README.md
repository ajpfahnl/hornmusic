# SOMus: Sensibly Organized Music

Somus is a personal project of mine to establish a platform for music metadata tabulated and stored in a sensible way. Unlike Spotify and many other music services, composers, orchestras, arrangers, and soloists aren't all lumped under the single category of "artist", but rather their actual roles in a piece. This web application is written in Python with Django and is currently deployed on Heroku.

The deployed web application can be found at https://somus.herokuapp.com/.
